\section{Our QPIP Scheme}

Here we create a QPIP scheme for...  In the case for decision problems, it would be a simple Chernoff bound as in \cite{kitaev2002classical}. A prover, honest or not, couldn't do better than sending $n$ identical copies of some state. The same reasoning does not generalize to our case, so instead we give the following construction.

We first give an alternative characterization of $\QPIP_0$.

\begin{definition}
	A sampling problem $S=(D_x)$ is said to be in $\QPIP_{XZ}$, or has a $\QPIP_{XZ}$ protocol,  with completeness $c$ and soundness $s$ if there exists a pair of algorithms $(\bbP, \bbV)$ with the following properties with input $x$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\bbP$ is a $\BQP$ machine.
		\item $\bbV$ is a hybrid quantum-classical machine. Its classical part is a $\BPP$ machine. Its quantum part is a single-qubit register, on which the verifier can apply only $X$ or $Z$ measurements.
		\item There is a quantum channel between $\bbP$ and $\bbV$ that can transmit one qubit at a time.
		\item There is a classical communication channel between $\bbP$ and $\bbV$.
		\item (Completeness) After interacting with $\bbP$, $\bbV$ accepts with probability $\geq c$.
		\item (Soundness) Given $\bbP'$, if $(\bbP', \bbV)$ accepts with probability greater than $\delta$, then conditioned on this acceptance, $\bbV$'s outputs has distribution $\tilde{D}$ with $\norm{\tilde{D}-D_x}\leq s$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	$\QPIP_{XZ}=\QPIP_0$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	See \cite{mahadev_delegation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	There is a $\QPIP_{XZ}$ protocol for \autoref{AlgGroundStateCheck}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The prover simply sends the input qubit-by-qubit for the verifier to measure. It is obvious that any attacks on this scheme trivially maps onto an attack on the original scheme.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	$\SampBQP$ is in $\QPIP_{XZ}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

	Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ accepts $\ket{\psi}$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, and any states perpendicular to it with probability $\frac{1}{2}-\Delta$.

	Let $\varepsilon>0$, $p>0$. Pick $n\in\mathbb{N}$ so that by Chernoff bound:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\ket{\psi^{\otimes n}}$ is rejected with probability at most $p$.
		\item If $\mathcal{F}(\ket{\phi})$ has less than $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ accept probability, then $\ket{\phi^{\otimes n}}$ is accepted with probability at most $p$.
	\end{itemize}

	\floatname{algorithm}{Protocol}
	\begin{algorithm}
		\caption{Our $\QPIP_{XZ}$ protocol}
		\label{AlgAmp1}
		\begin{algorithmic}[1]
			\State Pick $m$ large enough so that $\frac{1}{2^m}$ is negligible in $\varepsilon$
			\State Pick $n$ large enough so, $P\left[Bin(n, \frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)<\left(\frac{1}{2}-2\varepsilon\right)n\right]$ is negligible in $\varepsilon$ by Chernoff bound
			\State Pick $N$ large enough so that $\sqrt{\frac{2(m+n)^2\ln\abs{A}}{N-(m+n)}}=O(\poly(\varepsilon))$, where $\abs{A}$ is the number of qubits in $\ket{\psi_{C(x)}}$.
			\State The honest prover sends $N$ identical copies of $\ket{\psi_{C'(x)}}$, where $C'$ is $C$ padded with identities as mentioned in \hyperref[idpadding]{Observation~\ref*{idpadding}}
			\State The verifier randomly picks $n+m$ copies in sequence and without replacement
			\State The verifier runs \autoref{AlgGroundStateCheck} on $n$ of the copies
			\If{over $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)n$ copies accept}
			\For{$i\gets 1, m$}
				\State Measure the time register of a fresh copy from the prover
				\If{Measured $t\geq T$}
					\State Measure and output the other registers
				\EndIf
			\EndFor
			\State Reject
			\Else
			\State Reject
			\EndIf
		\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}

	This clearly has completeness negligibly close to $1$. Now we analyze soundness, for a possibly cheating prover.

	Picking $n+m$ out of $N$ registers is equivalent to first applying a random permutation then taking the first $n+m$ registers. Denote the state at that point as

	$$\sigma'=\frac{1}{\abs{\Sym(N)}}\sum_{\Pi\in\Sym(N)}\Pi\sigma\Pi^\dagger$$

	Let $\tilde{\Pi}$ be some fixed permutation. Then it is easy to check that

	$$\tilde{\Pi}\sigma'\tilde{\Pi}^\dagger=\sigma'$$

	So $\sigma'$ is permutation-invariant and we can apply \autoref{deFinetti}:

	$$\norm{\sigma'-\sum_i w_i\rho_i^{\otimes n+m}}=O(\poly(\varepsilon))$$

	Note that this is a classical probability distribution over inputs $\rho_i^{\otimes n+m}$ with $w_i$ as weights.

	Let $q_j$ be the accept probability of $\ket{\rho_j^{\otimes n+m}}$ under \hyperref[AlgAmp1]{Protocol~\ref*{AlgAmp1}}. By Bayes' theorem, conditioned on acceptance, the probability of the input being $\ket{\rho_j^{\otimes n+m}}$ is then $\frac{w_j q_j}{\sum_i w_i q_i}$.

	Let $J=\set{j:q_j<p}$.

	$\Rightarrow\sum_{j\in J} w_j q_j<p$, since $\sum_i w_i=1$.

	$\Rightarrow\frac{\sum_{j\in J} w_j q_j}{\sum_i w_i q_i}<\frac{p}{\delta}$.

	So we pad the circuit with identity matrices at the end before constructing... TODO, if we measured $t>\frac{T}{2}$ on the time register, we would know that the other registers include the output of the required quantum computation. So simply take $m$ to be high enough that it happens at least once with overwhelming probability. When it does, measure the entire register. All the errors up to this point are $O(\varepsilon)$, so will be the distance between this output distribution and the true one.

\end{proof}
