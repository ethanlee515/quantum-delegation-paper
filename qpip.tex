\section{Delegation Protocol for $\QPIP_1$ Client}

In this section, we construct a one-message $\QPIP_1$ delegation protocol for $\SampBQP$.
At a high level, it is a cut-and-choose protocol.
The server constructs multiple copies of the ground state as certificates,
then the client randomly chooses a copy to output and checks the rest.
Unfortunately our approach incurs inverse polynomial soundness errors.

There are two main challenges to this cut-and-choose approach.
First, the client needs to reliably extract the circuit output from its corresponding ground state.
We accomplish this by padding the circuit with identity gates at the end.
By doing so, the clock register collapses to after the last non-identity gate with high probability.

The other challenge is that a cheating prover's certificates can be arbitrarily entangled,
so common techniques such as Chernoff bounds can't be applied as-is.
This wasn't a challenge for $\Piblind$ for $\BQP$ earlier because...
\Ethan{TODO; need brief and intuitive explanation}
In our case with $\SampBQP$, we overcome this challenge instead by using de Finetti's theorem
to approximate our measurement results with that of some unentangled copies,
within inverse polynomial errors.

We start with a $\SampBQP$ problem $(D_x)_{x\in\set{0, 1}^*}$ and an input $x$,
then there exists some quantum circuit $C$ that samples from $D_x$ within desired accuracy.
We assume without loss of generality that $C$ comprises of only Hadamard and Toffoli gates.
We present our protocol that allows a client to verifiably obtain the measurement outcome of $C(x)$.

\begin{protocol}{$\QPIP_1$ protocol $\PiSamp$ for the computation $C(x)$ with error parameter $\varepsilon$}
	\label{ProtoQPIP1}

	Inputs:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Error parameter $\varepsilon\in(0, 1)$
		\item Input string $x\in\set{0, 1}^n$
		\item Quantum circuit $C$ of size $T$ consisting of only Hadamard and Toffoli gates
	\end{itemize}

	Ingrediants:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let $C'$ be $C$ padded with $\frac{T}{\varepsilon}$ identity gates at the end.
		\item Let $\ket{\psi_{C'(x)}}$ be the local Hamiltonian ground state associated with $C'$ as defined in \Cref{thm:LHReduction}.
		\item $\cVGS$ be the way to check said ground state as defined in \Cref{AlgGroundStateCheck}.
		\item Define $c\in\bbR$ as in \Cref{cor:HamCheck}.
	\end{itemize}

	Pseudocode:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The honest prover prepares $M=\frac{T^{20}}{\varepsilon^{32}}\ln(\frac{T}{\varepsilon})$ copies \Ethan{This isn't an integer...?} of $\ket{\psi_{C'(x)}}$ and sends all of it to the verifier qubit-by-qubit.
		\item The verifier privately samples $I\subset[M]$ s.t. $\abs{I}=m$ where $m=\frac{T^{10}}{\varepsilon^{15}}$, and $k\xleftarrow{\$}[M]\setminus I$.
			For $i$ from $1$ to $M$, it chooses what to do to the $i$-th copy, $\rho_i$, as follows:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item If $i\in I$, run $z_i\leftarrow\cV_{\GS}(\rho_i)$.
			\item Else if $i=k$, measure the data register \Ethan{Revisit this name} of $\rho_i$ and save the outcome as $y$.
			\item Else, discard $\rho_i$.
		\end{enumerate}
			Let $Z=\sum_{i\in I} z_i$. If $Z>\frac{m}{2}-\kappa m$ where $\kappa=\frac{c\varepsilon^2}{2\left(T+\frac{T}{\varepsilon}\right)^5}$ then the verifier accepts and outputs $y$. Otherwise, it rejects.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{protocol}

Note that $\VSamp$ only needs to apply $X$ and $Z$ measurements, and is classical otherwise.
It is easy to see $\PiSamp$ runs in $\poly(T, \varepsilon^{-1})$ time.
We now show its completeness and soundness.

\begin{thm}
    \label{QPIP1thm}
	$\PiSamp$ has negligible completeness error and $\poly(\varepsilon^{-1})$ soundness error.
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
	For completeness, notice $z_i$ are i.i.d. Bernoulli trials with success probability $\frac{1}{2}$.
	So we can apply Chernoff bound (\Cref{thm:Chernoff}) with $\mu=\frac{m}{2}$ and $\delta=\frac{c\varepsilon^2}{\left(T+\frac{T}{\varepsilon}\right)^5}$ to get
	$$\Prob{Z>\frac{m}{2}-\varepsilon m}\leq2e^{-\frac{\mu\delta^2}{3}}=\negl(\varepsilon^{-1}).$$

	Now we show soundness.
	Suppose $\PSampstar$ is a cheating prover that sends some $\sigma$ to the verifier.

	The first step of our analysis is to use de Finetti's theorem.
	Randomly picking $m+1$ out of $M$ registers is equivalent to first applying a random permutation to get some $\sigma'$ then taking the first $m+1$ registers.
	A random permutation, in turn, is a classical mix over all possible permutations:
	$$\sigma'=\frac{1}{\abs{\Sym(M)}}\sum_{\Pi\in\Sym(M)}\Pi\sigma\Pi^\dagger.$$
	It is simple to check that $\sigma'$ is permutation-invariant:
	fix $\tilde{\Pi}\in\Sym(M)$, then
	$$\tilde{\Pi}\sigma'\tilde{\Pi}^\dagger
	=\frac{1}{\abs{\Sym(M)}}\sum_{\Pi\in\Sym(M)}\tilde{\Pi}\Pi\sigma\Pi^\dagger\tilde{\Pi}^\dagger
	=\frac{1}{\abs{\Sym(M)}}\sum_{\hat{\Pi}\in\Sym(M)}\hat{\Pi}\sigma\hat{\Pi}^\dagger
	=\sigma'$$
	where the second equality is by relabeling $\tilde{\Pi}\Pi=\hat{\Pi}$.

	Now we apply de Finetti's theorem (\Cref{deFinetti}) to approximate $\sigma'$ with a classical mix over tensors of independent states.
	Note that the ground state has $\abs{A}=n+T+\frac{T}{e}$ qubits.
	That is, $\exists\rho=\sum_j w_j\rho_j^{\otimes m+1}$ such that for all quantum-classical channels $\Lambda_i$ on $\abs{A}$ qubits:
	$$\norm{\Lambda_1\otimes\ldots\otimes\Lambda_{m+1}(\sigma'-\rho)}
	\leq\sqrt{\frac{2m^2\ln\left(n+T+\frac{T}{\varepsilon}\right)}{M-m}}
	=O(\varepsilon).$$

	Now we separate the $\rho_j$ into two categories base on $p_j$, the accept probability of $\cVGS(\rho_j)$:
	$$J=\set{j\in I|p_j<\frac{1}{2}-2\kappa}$$

	First suppose $j\in J$, we use a standard Chernoff bound argument as follows to show that this case has negligible acceptance probabilities,
	hence incurs negligible soundness errors.
	Let $Y=\sum y_j$ be i.i.d. Bernoulli trials with success probabilities $p_y=\frac{1}{2}-2\kappa$,
	then clearly $\Prob{Z\geq\frac{m}{2}-\kappa m}<\Prob{Y\geq\frac{m}{2}-\kappa m}$.
	By Chernoff bound, we have
	$$\Prob{Y\geq\frac{m}{2}-\kappa m}\leq2e^{-\frac{\mu\delta^2}{3}}=\negl(\varepsilon^{-1})$$
	where $\mu=mp_y=\frac{m}{2}-2\kappa m$ and $\delta=\frac{2\kappa}{1-4\kappa}$.
	Summing up all the $\rho_j$ terms in $J$, we have
	$$\sum_{j\in J} w_j q_j<2^{-\lambda}=\negl(\lambda).$$

	Now, for the other case, $j\notin J$, by \Cref{cor:HamCheck} we have a lower bound for the fidelity between $\rho_j$ and $\psi_{C'(x)}$:
	$$p_j>\frac{1}{2}-2\kappa\Rightarrow F(\rho_j, \psi_{C'(x)})\geq\varepsilon^2.$$
	which in turn implies a lower bound on the respective trace distance:
	$$T(\rho_j, \ket{\psi_{C'(x)}})<\varepsilon.$$

	The probability of measuring $t<T$ on the clock register of $\ket{\phi_{C'(x)}}$ is $\poly(\varepsilon)$ due to the padding,
	so the data register has $1-\poly(\varepsilon)$ probability to be $C(x)$ at this point.

	The soundness errors at each step is $O(\varepsilon)$, so the conclusion follows.
\end{prf}
