\section{Our QPIP Scheme}

Here we create a QPIP scheme for...  In the case for decision problems, it would be a simple Chernoff bound as in \cite{kitaev2002classical}. A prover, honest or not, couldn't do better than sending $n$ identical copies of some state. The same reasoning does not generalize to our case, so instead we give the following construction.

We first give an alternative characterization of $\QPIP_0$.

\begin{definition}
	A sampling problem $S=(D_x)$ is said to be in $\QPIP_{XZ}$, or has a $\QPIP_{XZ}$ protocol,  with completeness $c$ and soundness $s$ if there exists a pair of algorithms $(\bbP, \bbV)$ with the following properties with input $x$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\bbP$ is a $\BQP$ machine.
		\item $\bbV$ is a hybrid quantum-classical machine. Its classical part is a $\BPP$ machine. Its quantum part is a single-qubit register, on which the verifier can apply only $X$ or $Z$ measurements.
		\item There is a quantum channel between $\bbP$ and $\bbV$ that can transmit one qubit at a time.
		\item There is a classical communication channel between $\bbP$ and $\bbV$.
		\item (Completeness) After interacting with $\bbP$, $\bbV$ accepts with probability $\geq c$.
		\item (Soundness) Given $\bbP'$, if $(\bbP', \bbV)$ accepts with probability greater than $\delta$, then conditioned on this acceptance, $\bbV$'s outputs has distribution $\tilde{D}$ with $\norm{\tilde{D}-D_x}\leq s$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	$\QPIP_{XZ}=\QPIP_0$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	See \cite{mahadev_delegation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	There is a $\QPIP_{XZ}$ protocol for \autoref{AlgGroundStateCheck}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The prover simply sends the input qubit-by-qubit for the verifier to measure. It is obvious that any attacks on this scheme trivially maps onto an attack on the original scheme.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	$\SampBQP$ is in $\QPIP_{XZ}$ with completeness negligible to perfect and soundness $1-O(T^{-c})$ for any constant $c$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

	\floatname{algorithm}{Protocol}
	\begin{algorithm}

		\begin{algorithmic}[1]
			\State $\varepsilon\gets T^{-c}$

			\State The honest prover sends $N$ identical copies of $\ket{\psi_{C'(x)}}$, where $C'$ is $C$ padded with identities as mentioned in \hyperref[idpadding]{Observation~\ref*{idpadding}}

		\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}

	This clearly has completeness negligibly close to $1$. Now we analyze soundness against a possibly cheating prover.

	Picking $n+m$ out of $N$ registers is equivalent to first applying a random permutation then taking the first $n+m$ registers. Denote the state at that point as

	$$\sigma'=\frac{1}{\abs{\Sym(N)}}\sum_{\Pi\in\Sym(N)}\Pi\sigma\Pi^\dagger$$

	Let $\tilde{\Pi}$ be some fixed permutation. Then it is easy to check that

	$$\tilde{\Pi}\sigma'\tilde{\Pi}^\dagger=\sigma'$$

	So $\sigma'$ is permutation-invariant and we can apply \autoref{deFinetti}:

	$$\norm{\sigma'-\sum_i w_i\rho_i^{\otimes n+m}}=O(\poly(\varepsilon))$$

	TODO set $\tilde{\sigma}$ and fix above to be product measure

	Note that this is a classical probability distribution over inputs $\rho_i^{\otimes n+m}$ with $w_i$ as weights.

	Let $q_i$ be the accept probability of at least $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)n$ copies from $\rho_i^{\otimes n}$ accept under \autoref{AlgGroundStateCheck}. By Bayes' theorem, conditioned on acceptance, the probability of $\tilde{\sigma}$ being $\ket{\rho_i^{\otimes n+m}}$ is then $\frac{w_i q_i}{\sum_j w_j q_j}$.

	Define $J$ to be the set of $j$s where $q_j$ is negligible. TODO negligible shenanigans

	$$\sum_{j\in J} w_j q_j$$

	$$\Rightarrow\frac{\sum_{j\in J} w_j q_j}{\sum_i w_i q_i}<\frac{p}{\delta}$$

	Now let $\rho_i$ be with over probability $1-2\varepsilon$ to be accepted by \autoref{AlgGroundStateCheck}. So it is $O(\poly(\varepsilon))$-close to $\ket{\psi_{C(x)}}$.

	So we simply measure the time register until we get a result where we can extract $C(x)$. The probability of failing to do so after all $m$ copies is $\frac{1}{2^m}$ which is negligible.

	All errors up to this point is $O(\poly(\varepsilon))$.

\end{proof}
