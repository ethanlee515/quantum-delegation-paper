\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Notations}

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Hilbert space corresponding to one qubit. Let $H:\mathcal{B}^{\otimes n}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}^{\otimes n}$ be Hermitian matrices. We use $H\geq0$ to denote $H$ being positive semidefinite. Let $\lambda(H)$ be the smallest eigenvalue of $H$. The ground states of $H$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to $\lambda(H)$. For matrix $H$ and subspace $S$, let $H\big|_S=\Pi_S H \Pi_S$, where $\Pi_S$ is the projector onto the subspace $S$.
%For a $T$-qubit Hilbert space, let the state $\ket{\widehat{t}}=\ket{1}^{\otimes t}\otimes \ket{0}^{{\otimes (T-t)}}$.
We write $x\xleftarrow{\$}X$ when $x$ is sampled uniformly at random from the set $X$.

The phase gate and Pauli matrices are the following matrices.

\begin{definition}
    $P(i)=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&i\end{pmatrix}$,
    $X=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}$,
    $Y=\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\i&0\end{pmatrix}$,
    $Z=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{pmatrix}$.
\end{definition}

For $n$-qubit states $\rho_1, \rho_2\in\cB^{\otimes n}$,
let $\norm{\rho_1-\rho_2}_{tr}=\frac{1}{2}\norm{\rho_1-\rho_2}_1$ denote the trace distance between $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. We say $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are $\eps$-close if $\norm{\rho_1- \rho_2}_{tr}\leq\eps$.
For two distributions $f_1$ and $f_2$ over the same finite domain $X$, let $\norm{f_1-f_2}_{TV}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{x\in X}\abs{f_1(x)-f_2(x)}$ denote their total variation distance,
and we say $f_1$ and $f_2$ are $\eps$-close if $\norm{f_1-f_2}_{TV}\leq\eps$.
We additionally denote the following for states that are only computationally indistinguishable (but might be statistically far):
\begin{definition}
\label{def:comp-indis}
    Two ensemble of states $\set{\rho_{1,\lambda}}_{\lambda\in\bbN}$ and $\set{\rho_{2,\lambda}}_{\lambda\in\bbN}$ are \emph{$\eps$-computationally indistinguishable} if for all $\BQP$ distinguishers $\mathsf{D}$ and $\lambda\in\bbN$,
    $$\abs{\Pr\left[\mathsf{D}(\rho_{1,\lambda})=1\right]-\Pr\left[\mathsf{D}(\rho_{2,\lambda})=1\right]}\leq\eps(\lambda).$$
    % We also denote $\eps$-computational indistinguishability by $\rho_{1,\lambda}\approx_{c, \eps}\rho_{2,\lambda}$.
    We drop the $\eps$ parameter when it is negligible.
    We extend computational indistinguishability to subnormalized states by taking the distinguisher $\mathsf{D}$ to output subnormalized states as appropriate.
    We also extend it to distributions by treating them as mixed states.
\end{definition}

We denote measurement as follows:
\begin{definition} [quantum-classical channels]
    \label{def:QCChannel}
    A quantum measurement is given by a set of matrices $\set{M_k}$ such that $M_k\geq0$ and $\sum_k M_k=\id$.
    We associate to any measurement a map $\Lambda(\rho)=\sum_k \tr(M_k\rho)\proj{k}$
    with $\{\ket{k}\}$ an orthonormal basis.
    This map is also called a \emph{quantum-classical channel}.
\end{definition}
Furthermore, we associate measurement outcomes in $X$ or $Z$ basis with a corresponding random variable as follows:
\begin{definition}[$M_{XZ}(\rho,h)$]
	For any natural number $n$, $n$-bit string $h$, and $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$, consider the following measurement procedure: measure the first qubit of $\rho$ in $X$ basis if $h_1=0$; measure the first qubit of $\rho$ in $Z$ basis if $h_1=1$.  Measure the second qubit of $\rho$ in $X$ basis if $h_2=0$; measure the second qubit of $\rho$ in $Z$ basis if $h_2=1$. Continue qubit-by-qubit until all $n$-qubits of $\rho$ are measured, where $i$-th qubit is measured in $X$ basis if $h_i=0$ and  $i$-th qubit is measured in the $Z$ basis if $h_i=1$.

	We denote the $n$-bit random variable corresponding to the measurement results as $M_{XZ}(\rho,h)$.
\end{definition}


\subsection{Quantum Prover Interactive Protocols (QPIP)}

Following \cite{FOCS:Mahadev18a}, we model the interaction between a (almost classical) client and a quantum server in the following definition.
When the client has limited quantum memories (i.e., $\tau > 0$), this is a ``streaming" model. That is, the server can send qubits one-by-one to let client measure them sequentially, even if the client cannot hold the entire quantum message.
When the client is fully classical (i.e, $\tau = 0$), this model specializes to the standard rounds-based interactive protocols.

\begin{definition}
    A protocol $\Pi=(P, V)$ is said to be in $\QPIP_\tau$ if it satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P$ is a $\BQP$ machine, which also has access to a quantum channel that can transmit $\tau$ qubits to the verifier per use.
        \item $V$ is a hybrid machine of a classical part and a limited quantum part. The classical part is a $\BPP$ machine. The quantum part is a register of $\tau$ qubits, on which the verifier can perform arbitrary quantum operations and which has access to a quantum channel which can transmit $\tau$ qubits. At any given time, the verifier is not allowed to possess more than $\tau$ qubits. The interaction between the quantum and classical parts of the verifier is the usual one: the classical part controls which operations are to be performed on the quantum register, and outcomes of measurements of the quantum register can be used as input to the classical part.
        \item There is also a classical communication channel between the prover and the verifier, which can transmit polynomially many bits to either direction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

It is straightforward to define what it means for a $\QPIP_\tau$ protocol to decide a $\BQP$ language.

\begin{definition}
    Let $\Pi=(P, V)$ be a $\QPIP_\tau$ protocol.
    We say it is a protocol for a $\BQP$ language $L$ with completeness error $c(\cdot)$ and soundness error $s(\cdot)$ if the following holds:
\begin{itemize}
        \item On public inputs $1^\lambda$ and $x\in\zo^*$, the verifier outputs either $\Acc$ or $\Rej$.
        \item (Completeness): For all security parameter $\lambda\in\bbN$ and $x\in\zo^{\poly(\lambda)}$, if $x\in L$ then
        $\Pr\left[(P, V)(x, 1^\lambda)=\Rej\right]<c(\lambda)$.
        \item (Soundness): For all cheating $\BQP$ prover $P^*$, sufficiently large security parameter $\lambda\in\bbN$, and $x\in\zo^{\poly(\lambda)}$, if $x \notin L$ then $\Pr\left[(P, V)(x, 1^\lambda)=\Rej\right]<s(\lambda)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

We are particularly interested in the case that $\tau = 0$, i.e., when the verifier $V$ is classical. In this case, we say $\Pi$ is a CVQC protocol for the $\BQP$ language $L$.


We now define blindness, which means that the prover does not learn any information about the verifier's input except for its length.
As such, in this context, we consider the input $x$ as the verifier's private input instead of a common input.  

\Ethan{The following blindness definition is more crypto-based, but since we're submitting it to Eurocrypt maybe this is fine as-is?}

\begin{definition}[Blindness]
    Let $\Pi=(P, V)$ be an interactive protocol with common inputs $1^\lambda$ 
    %(and $1^{1/\eps}$ for the case of $\SampBQP$ problem), 
    and verifier's private input $x\in\zo^*$.
    We say $\Pi$ is \emph{blind} if for all cheating $\BQP$ prover $P^*$ the following ensembles are computationally indistinguishable over $\lambda$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\set{\View_{P^*}(P^*, V(x))(1^\lambda)}_{\lambda\in\bbN, \eps\in(0,1), x\in\zo^*}$
        \item $\set{\View_{P^*}(P^*, V(0))(1^\lambda)}_{\lambda\in\bbN, \eps\in(0^{|x|},1), x\in\zo^*}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Probably not necessary

\begin{lem}[triangle inequality for computational distance] \label{lem:computational-triangle0}
    Let $\rho_1, \rho_2, \rho_3\in\cB^{\otimes n}$ such that
    \begin{align}
        \rho_1\approx_{c, \eps}\rho_2\\
        \rho_2\approx_{c, \eps'}\rho_3.
    \end{align}
    We have
    \begin{align}
        \rho_1\approx_{c, \eps+\eps'}\rho_3.
    \end{align}
\end{lem}

\fi

\subsection{Quantum Homomorphic Encryption Schemes}

We use the quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme given in \cite{mahadev_qfhe} which is compatible with our use of a classical client.
\begin{definition}
    A quantum leveled homomorphic (public-key) encryption scheme $\QHE=(\QGen,$ \linebreak
    $\QEnc, \QEval, \QDec)$ is quadruple of quantum polynomial-time algorithms which operate as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Key generation.}
            The algorithm $(pk, sk)\leftarrow\QGen(1^\lambda, 1^L)$ takes a unary representation of the security parameter and a unary representation of the level parameter as inputs and outputs a public key $pk$ and a secret key $sk$.
        \item \emph{Encryption.}
            The algorithm $c\leftarrow\QEnc(pk, \mu)$ takes the public key $pk$ and a single bit message $\mu\in\zo$ as inputs and outputs a ciphertext $c$.
        \item \emph{Decryption.}
            The algorithm $\mu^*\leftarrow\QDec(sk, c)$ takes the secret key $sk$ and a ciphertext $c$ as inputs and outputs a message $\mu^*\in\zo$.
            It must be the case that
                $$\QDec(sk, \QEnc(pk, \mu))=\mu$$
            with overwhelming probability in $\lambda$.
        \item \emph{Homomorphic Evaluation.}
            The algorithm $c_f\leftarrow\QEval(pk, f, c_1, \ldots, c_l)$ takes the public key $pk$, a quantum circuit $f$ of depth at most $L$, and a set of $l$ ciphertexts $c_1,\cdots,c_l$ as inputs and outputs a ciphertext $c_f$.
            It must be the case that
                $$\QDec(sk, \QEval(pk, f, c_1, \ldots, c_l))=f(\QDec(sk, c_1),\ldots,\QDec(sk, c_l))$$
            with overwhelming probability in $\lambda$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Compactness and Full Homomorphism]
    A quantum homomorphic encryption scheme $\QHE$ is compact if
    there exists a polynomial $s$ in $\lambda$ such that the output length of $\QEval$ is at most $s$ bits long (regardless of $f$ or
    the number of inputs). A compact scheme is (pure) fully homomorphic if it can evaluate any efficiently computable
    boolean function.
\end{definition}

We also recall the security definition for a FHE scheme.

\begin{definition}
    A scheme $\QHE$ is IND-CPA secure if, for any polynomial time adversary $\cA$, there exists a negligible function $\mu(\cdot)$ such that
    $$\abs{Pr[\cA(pk, \mathsf{HE.Enc}_{pk}(0))=1]-Pr[\cA(pk, \mathsf{HE.Enc}_{pk}(1))=1]}\leq\mu(\lambda)$$
    where $(pk, sk)\leftarrow\QGen(1^\lambda)$
\end{definition}

The quantum homomorphic encryption scheme $\mathsf{QHE}$ from \cite{mahadev_qfhe} has additional properties that facilitate the use of classical clients.

\begin{definition} \label{def:classical-friendly}
    we call a quantum homomorphic encryption scheme \emph{classical-friendly} if it has the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\QGen$ is a classical algorithm
        \item In the case where the plaintext is classical, $\QEnc$ can be done classically.
        \item When the underlying message is classical, the corresponding ciphertext is also classical and can be decrypted classically.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} [Theorem 1.1 in \cite{mahadev_qfhe}]
    Under the assumption that the learning with errors problem with superpolynomial noise ratio is computationally intractable for an efficient quantum machine,
    there exists a classical-friendly compact quantum leveled homomorphic encryption scheme.
\end{theorem}
