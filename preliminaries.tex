\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Notations}

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Hilbert space corresponding to one qubit. Let $H:\mathcal{B}^{\otimes N}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}^{\otimes N}$ be Hermitian matrices. We use $H\geq0$ to denote $H$ being positive semidefinite. Let $\lambda(H)$ be the smallest eigenvalue of $H$. The ground states of $H$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to $\lambda(H)$. For matrix $H$ and subspace $S$, let $H\big|_S=\Pi_S H \Pi_S$, where $\Pi_S$ is the projector onto the subspace $S$. For a $T$-qubit Hilbert space, let the state $\ket{\widehat{t}}=\ket{1}^{\otimes t}\otimes \ket{0}^{{\otimes (T-t)}}$. Let $\Lambda_c(U)$ denote the gate $U$ controlled on qubit $c$, and $\Lambda^2_{f, s}(U)$ denote the gate $U$ controlled by both $f$ and $s$. I.e. $\Lambda^2_{1, 2}(X_3)$ would be a Toffoli (CCNOT) gate. 

The phase gate and Pauli matrices are denoted as follows.

\begin{definition}
	$P(i)=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&i\end{pmatrix}$, $X=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}$,
	$Y=\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\i&0\end{pmatrix}$,
	$Z=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{pmatrix}$
\end{definition}

We define a sampling version of $\BQP$, $\SampBQP$, based on \cite{aaronson_2013}.

\begin{definition} [sampling problem]
	A sampling problem $S$ is a collection of probability distributions $(D_x)$, one for each input string $x\in\set{0,1}^n$, where $D_x$ is a distribution over $\set{0,1}^{p(n)}$ for some fixed polynomial $p$.
\end{definition}
    
\hannote{sampling generalize decision blah} \Ethan{That doesn't sound right}

\begin{definition} [$\SampBQP$]
	$\SampBQP$ is the class of sampling problems $S=(D_x)$ for which for all $\varepsilon$ there exists a quantum circuit constructible in time $\poly(|x|, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ that, given $x$ as input, samples from from a probability distribution $\tilde{D}_x$ such that $\norm{\tilde{D}_x-D_x}<\varepsilon$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Quantum Prover Interactive Protocol (QPIP)}
We classify the interaction between a (almost classical) client and a quantum server for sampling problems, extending the classification by \cite{mahadev_delegation}.

\begin{definition}
	A sampling problem $S=(D_x)$ is said to be in $\QPIP_\tau$ with completeness $c$ and soundness $(\delta, s)$ if there exists a protocol $(\bbP, \bbV)$ with the following properties with input $x$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\bbP$ is run by the prover, a $\BQP$ machine, which also has access to a quantum channel that can transmit $\tau$ qubits to the verifier per use.
		\item $\bbV$ is run by the verifier, which is a hybrid machine of a classical part and a limited quantum part. The classical part is a $\BPP$ machine. The quantum part is a register of $\tau$ qubits, on which the verifier can perform arbitrary quantum operations and which has access to a quantum channel which can transmit $\tau$ qubits. At any given time, the verifier is not allowed to possess more than $\tau$ qubits. The interaction between the quantum and classical parts of the verifier is the usual one: the classical part controls which operations are to be performed on the quantum register, and outcomes of measurements of the quantum register can be used as input to the classical part.
		\item There is also a classical communication channel between the prover and the verifier, which can transmit $\poly(\abs{x})$ many bits to either direction. 
		\item (Completeness) After interacting with $\bbP$, $\bbV$ accepts with probability $\geq c$.
		\item (Soundness) For all $\bbP'$, if $(\bbP', \bbV)$ accepts with probability greater than $\delta$, then conditioned on this acceptance, $\bbV$ outputs a distribution $\tilde{D}$ with $\norm{\tilde{D}-D_x}\leq s$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Semantic security for interactive protocols}

We present the security definition for interactive protocols:

\begin{dfn}
	Let $\lambda$ be a security parameter.
	Let $(\bbP, \bbV)$ be an interactive protocol with security parameter $\lambda$.
	Then it is IND-CPA secure if $\forall x\in\set{0,1}^n$ no polynomial time adversary $\cA$ can win \protoref{indcpa} with probability better than $\frac{1}{2}+\negl(\lambda)$
\end{dfn}

\begin{protocol}{Attack against semantic security}
	\label{proto:indcpa}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The challenge picks $b\in\set{0,1}$ at random
		\item If $b=0$, the challenger runs the protocol with the adversary, acting as the verifier with input $0^n$
		\item Otherwise, the challenger runs the protocol with the adversary, acting as the verifier with input $x$
		\item $\cA$ attempts to guess $b$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{protocol}

\subsection{Projection Lemma}

We use the projection lemma from \cite{kempe_kitaev_regev_2006}, which describes the conditions under which we can estimate the ground state energy of $H_1 + H_2$ with that of $H_1\big|_{\ker H_2}$.

\begin{thm}
	Let $H=H_1+H_2$ be the sum of two Hamiltonians operating on some Hilbert space $\cH=\cS+\cS^\bot$.
	The Hamiltonian $H_2$ is such that $\cS$ is a zero eigenspace and the eigenvectors in $\cS^\bot$ have eigenvalues at least $J>2\norm{H_1}$. Then,
	$$\lambda\left(H_1\big|_\cS\right)-\frac{\norm{H_1}^2}{J-2\norm{H_1}^2}\leq\lambda(H)\leq\lambda\left(H_1\big|_\cS\right)$$
\end{thm}

We will instead use the following formulation, which can be obtained by relabeling variables from above.

\begin{thm}
	\label{thm:projection}
	Let $H_1, H_2$ be local Hamiltonians where $H_2\geq0$. Let $K=\ker H_2$. Then,
	$$\exists J=\frac{\poly(\norm{H_1})}{\lambda\left(H_2\big|_{K^\bot}\right)}$$
	$$\lambda(H_1+JH_2)\geq\lambda\left(H_1\big|_K\right)-\frac{1}{8}$$
\end{thm}

\subsection{Quantum de Finetti Theorem under Local Measurements}

There are many formulations of quantum de Finetti theorems. We use the one from \cite{Brand√£o2017} because we need logarithmic dependence on $|A|$.
\begin{thm}
	\label{deFinetti}
	Let $\rho^{A_1\ldots A_k}$ be a permutation-invariant state. Then for every $0\leq l\leq k$ there exists states $\set{\rho_i}$ and $\set{p_i}\subset\bbR$ such that
	$$\max_{\Lambda_1,\ldots,\Lambda_l}\norm{(\Lambda_1\otimes\ldots\otimes\Lambda_l)\left(\rho^{A_1\ldots A_l}-\sum_ip_i\rho_i^{A_1}\otimes\ldots\otimes\rho_i^{A_l}\right)}_1\leq\sqrt{\frac{2l^2\ln\abs{A}}{k-l}}$$
\end{thm}

\subsection{Quantum Homomorphic Encryption Schemes}

We use the quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme given in \cite{mahadev_qfhe} which is compatible with our use of a classical client. We start by presenting the interface of a homomorphic encryption scheme:

\begin{dfn}
	A leveled homomophic encryption scheme is tuple of algorithms $\mathsf{HE}=(\mathsf{HE.Keygen}, \mathsf{HE.Enc}, \mathsf{HE.Dec}, \mathsf{HE.Eval})$ with the following descriptions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mathsf{HE.Keygen}(1^\lambda, 1^L)\rightarrow(pk, evk, sk)$
		\item $\mathsf{HE.Enc}_{pk}(\mu)\rightarrow c$
		\item $\mathsf{HE.Dec}_{sk}(c)\rightarrow \mu^*$
		\item $\mathsf{HE.Eval}_{evk}(f, c_1, \ldots, c_l)\rightarrow c_f$
	\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

$\mathsf{HE}$ also satisfies, with overwhelming probability in $\lambda$, that
$$\mathsf{HE.Dec}_{sk}(\mathsf{HE.Eval}_{evk}(f, c_1, \ldots, c_l)=f(\mathsf{HE.Dec}_{sk}(c_0),\ldots,\mathsf{HE.Dec}_{sk}(c_l))$$
where $f$ is specified by a circuit of depth at most $L$.

\Ethan{To be pedantic, the above doesn't imply Dec undoes Enc even if we sub in $f=\id$.}

We also recall the security definition for a FHE scheme.

\begin{dfn}
	A FHE scheme $\mathsf{HE}$ is IND-CPA secure if, for any polynomial time adversary $\cA$, there exists a negligible function $\mu(\cdot)$ such that
	$$\abs{Pr[\cA(pk, evk, \mathsf{HE.Enc}_{pk}(0))=1]-Pr[\cA(pk, evk, \mathsf{HE.Enc}_{pk}(1))=1]}=\mu(\lambda)$$
	where $(pk, evk, sk)\leftarrow\mathsf{QHE.Keygen}(1^\lambda)$
\end{dfn}

The quantum homomorphic encryption scheme in \cite{mahadev_qfhe} has additional properties that facilitates the use of a classical clients as below:

\begin{thm}
	\label{decodeMeasureOrder}
	There exists a QFHE $\mathsf{QHE}=(\mathsf{QHE.Keygen}, \mathsf{QHE.Enc}, \mathsf{QHE.Dec}, \mathsf{QHE.Eval})$ with the following extra properties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mathsf{QHE.Keygen}$ can be done classically.
		\item In the case where the plaintext is classical, $\mathsf{QHE.Enc}$ can be done classically.
		\item \Ethan{Is this obvious from the construction or do we need proof here?} Let $\Lambda$ be a product of $X$ and $Z$ measurements. Then there exists product of $X$ and $Z$ measurements $\Lambda'$ and $\BPP$ algorithm $\widehat{\mathsf{QHE.Dec}}$ such that
			$$\Lambda\circ\mathsf{QHE.Dec}=\widehat{\mathsf{QHE.Dec}}\circ\Lambda'$$
	\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

As we will see, if a given protocol has classical inputs and uses only $X$ and $Z$ measurements, then $\mathsf{QHE}$ can be used as a compiler to achieve blindness.
